My Coding Style
============

The following document describes the rules of writing in development languages that I use: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The idea of this repository is to have a place for myself and other developers who participate in my projects able to inform the coding standards used.

Like this is a new document, some rules may not have been applied in old projects.
