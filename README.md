My Coding Style
============

The following document describes the rules of writing in development languages that I use: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The idea of this repository is to have a place for myself and other developers who participate in my projects able to inform the coding standards used.

Like this is a new document, some rules may not have been applied in old projects.

## Summary

1. [Commits] (#commits) 
2. [License](#license)
3. [References](#references)
 
<a name="commits"></a>
## Commits

For facilitate the contribution of any people in projects, all commit message, pull request title or issue discussion must be in **English**.

Before commit adjusts in project, check if exists one open issue and make references for this issue using '#' in your commit message.

```javascript
// Good
git commit -m "Add placeholder in input #10"

// Bad
git commit -m "Add placeholder in input"
```
